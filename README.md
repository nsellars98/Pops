# Pops
An MVC application to manage a Funko Pop collection. 

In addition to the MVC functionality with a database, the user can search for Funko Pops by name, type, or ID number via a drop-down next to the search. If the search returns results, a button allows the user to save the results to a text file.

A more in-depth description of the files and the MVC process can be found under the commits section.

Despite a cluttered display, the app is a working solution.

Proof of test cases for the different CRUD operations can be found in the corresponding Word document along with screenshots showing the code when running.

This app was developed with JetBrains PhpStorm (various versions), the XAMPP package for Windows (versions 7.3.1 - 7.4.11), and an online SQLite browser (https://extendsclass.com/).

Thanks for looking!
